1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
Handling Missing Data: Used Excel functions to identify and treat missing values. Rows with significant missing information were either removed or imputed using average/median where appropriate.
Data Validation: Ensured that all input fields, such as dates and numeric fields, were in the correct format using Excel's data validation features.
Duplicates Removal: Leveraged Excel's Remove Duplicates function to ensure the dataset had no redundancy, ensuring accurate analysis.
Data Normalization: Standardized values (e.g., product categories, price ranges) for consistency across the dataset using Excel formulas.
2. Data Analysis:
Descriptive Statistics: Utilized Excel's AVERAGE, MEDIAN, MODE, STDEV functions to get a better understanding of the central tendencies and variability in the data.
Pivot Tables: Generated Pivot Tables to break down sales by different dimensions, such as product category, time period, and geographic location.
Trend Analysis: Used line charts and moving averages to identify trends in sales over time.
Customer Segmentation: Analyzed customer data using Pivot Tables and applied Excel functions (IF, COUNTIF) to categorize customers by purchasing behavior.
Correlation Analysis: Applied Excel’s CORREL function to understand relationships between variables (e.g., sales and discount rates, inventory levels and sales).
